                I started learning how to create websites and brands back in the days of myspace. Customizing my and my
                friends profiles so they were “too legit to quit”. I didn’t think it was a big deal, and didn’t realize
                that some form of that could become an actual career, so I kept pursuing fashion. I still can be found
                sewing in much of my free time, but I realized I didn’t actually want it as a career. <br>Eventually, I
                realized I wanted to keep creating online! I started building more and more websites, for myself, for
                friends, and for local non-profits that I cared about. Through this I have truly found a career I am
                passionate about, and a niche helping small businesses improve their profitability, and helping
                non-profits have the social proof they need to get the funding for their programs.
